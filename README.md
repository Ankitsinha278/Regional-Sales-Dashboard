### 📌 Project Overview
The Regional Sales Dashboard is built to compare Primary and Secondary markets using visually intuitive charts and interactive filters. It provides a comparative view of average sales, customer reach, and product distribution across different geographic segments.

### ✅ Key Features
Primary vs. Secondary Regions
Segregated the dataset into Primary and Secondary regions for side-by-side comparison of sales performance, allowing users to identify strong and underperforming markets.

Sales by Sub-Category
Bar plots display total sales across product sub-categories, highlighting which product lines drive revenue in different regions.

Dual-Axis Bar Chart
Created a calculated field to compute Average Sales per Order, then visualized it alongside total sales using a dual-axis bar chart—ideal for comparing volume vs. efficiency.

Interactive Filters (Slicers)
Implemented slicers for Region, Customer, and Product to allow dynamic exploration of the data. Users can drill down into specific segments without altering the structure of the dashboard.

Distinct Count Measures
Extracted the distinct number of customers and products purchased in each region to analyze market reach and product diversity.
